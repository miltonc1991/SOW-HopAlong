# SOW-HopAlong
This project will simulate a ride-sharing service for the U.S., allowing users to post rides they are offering and request rides they need. Users will be able to see available trips, book a seat, and view ride details. The program will run in the console and store simple ride and user information

2. Goals
Create a user-friendly console application for posting and requesting rides.
Allow users to search for rides by city or date.
Enable basic ride management, including booking and viewing rides.
Practice working with arrays, structs, and functions in C++.

3. Deliverables
Program files (main.cpp + any additional .cpp or .h files)
Output.pdf with screenshots showing program functionality and explanations
GitHub submission with correct file structure

4. Timeline
Week 1–2: Define program structure, design structs/classes for users and rides, and set up GitHub repository
Week 3–4: Implement program features: add ride, search rides, book ride, display rides
Week 5: Test and debug the program, ensure correct input/output handling
Week 6: Write Output.pdf including screenshots and explanations
Week 7: Submit final project

5. Success Criteria
Program runs correctly and allows adding, searching, and booking rides
All required features are implemented
Output.pdf clearly documents program functionality with screenshots
All files are submitted on time via GitHub
